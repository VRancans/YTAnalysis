Carbon monoxide is deadly and having it stuck in a small room  can cost your lives without a warning, because you can't see or smell it and a carbon monoxid intoxication shows symptoms that can be associated with any other illness. please take care!",131,0,4.442748091603053

Bea Jonite,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x85xEw6OgXQ,Moving in together on a (realistic) millennials' budget,"This is gonna be a long one.... Well first, I just graduated from college with a bachelor in Secondary Education (YAY ME!), and I did it with 0 debt. How? Simple, I stayed with my parents, I studied in-state, I worked FULL TIME, while going to school full time, and I lived like a broke student. I was not lucky enough to have parents that could pay for my school, I had to do that all on my own, but I was lucky enough that they could allow me to live with them. I just had to pay the phone bill and internet, which was not bad considering. I drove a crappy car, I did not have the latest gadgets, I did not have anything name brand, or had anything under my name, but I was getting through. I did feel self-conscious for a while when people asked where I lived, or asked about what car I drove, mostly because I thought everyone else had their stuff together (I blame social media for that), but I soon realized that I was not the only one who lived like that. I always heard older people say how they had a nice car and house by the time they were my age, but I came to realize that a lot of my friends and co-workers were not at that level. I was the only one of my friends who were able to graduate from college. They had bills they had to pay and had to prioritize. A lot of my fellow classmates who did not have rich parents ended up with 17k or more in debt and almost all of the people that I know have credit card or school debt. I realized that my generation is struggling financially and have to prioritize having food and a roof over their heads over getting an education or even having nice things. This society has us fucked up if they expect us to have our shit together by the time we are 25. We are barely living.  Of course, we are not gonna be able to go to college, we are not gonna be able to buy houses and cars, we're not going to be able to spend money on things when we do not have money to spend! We barely make enough with the pay that they expect people to survive off if they do not have a degree or a high paying job. I worked 40-50 hours a week, with side jobs, and after paying my school bill (I was on a monthly payment plan) I always ended up with about $70-100 left that I had to stretch out for gas and food for the next two weeks. I was getting paid $12.33, which is higher than most. Now, I'm in the search for a job, and I'm hoping to move out by the end of the year, but it doesn't seem like I'll be able to since I want to be a homeowner instead of a renter. That's it for my rant about Millenials and how broke we are. So, congrats on moving in together!!! For those who feel self-conscious because you can't afford to move out, or can't afford nice things, it's ok. You're not alone! You'll get there one day!!!",551,0,4.0

I don't think I've ever considered that the ""Millennial struggles"" were truly world-wide. It's easy to see why/how Millennials are perceived somewhere like the United States where I grew up, but I'm a little relieved (and simultaneously really curious about) that it's not just here.

Often at night we would hear gun shots from the surrounding neighborhoods. We payed $900 for rent. We only stayed a year but if we were going to re-sign rent would have gone up another 100. This is part of the reason they say things are so different for millennials. Plus we are having to pay off our students loans while also paying rent and not having health insurance.

On the other hand, money is a big concern. You definitely will have to come to terms with your habits and decide on what treats you really need to be happy and what to eliminate. I found that saving some money for doing my own things really helps, but in order to do that, you have to get used to living alone and start adjusting those extra costs that initially you’ll spend. It’s normal, you never had to worry about certain expenses before.

Generally, what I'm gathering online does not seem to match well with what you are saying in the video. This is not an attack, this is genuine attempt to understand.

Bea Jonite,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCPVYY-Gi8U,I am running for Parliament | Beata Jonite,"I know I'm late to comment here, Bea...but won't that DUI you had a few years back mitigate your chances of qualifying?  Maybe, maybe not.   I really don't understand how it works in Latvia.  I just know that if someone in America gets slapped with that, they have to be super well-connected to ever stand any chance at running for office.  Newbies at the game who are found to have that on their record get destroyed mercilessly.  

Not because drunks are so hated, but because garbage rivals see it as an easy way to trash someone without having to take heat for taking a position on a real issue.  Is it like that in Latvia too, or is that just an American thing?  Hopefully it's different there.  Because when they pull that crap Stateside, it gets ugly fast.  And they don't limit it to just the individual running for office.  Family is seldom off limits anymore either here.

I still remember how when Bush was around, few Democrats wanted to argue the substance of any of his positions.  So instead, they attacked his daughters for their sketchy behaviors from years earlier...while ignoring Malia Obama's drug abuse scandals entirely.

I get wanting to make a difference.  I'm just hoping regardless whatever happens, that the past doesn't become a permanent prologue.  I won't even run for county drain commissioner, because of an ex-girlfriend from 2014 who might be up to no good if she found out.  (Imagine finding out your date was basically the Devil in disguise.)  Running in spite a DUI?  I don't even want to imagine the stress!",268,0,4.6940298507462686

Bea Jonite,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPmvMaDKk0,"New Tattoo, Weed Plantations & Near-Death Experiences ⋆ INDIA VLOG #3","As an Indian who has traveled to a few places in his country, there are a few things I can tell you.

There are touts (or frauds) bloody everywhere. They will almost always try to humbug you into their illegal activities. Typically, they would try and take you to accommodations in areas even locals would avoid or get you to exchange your foreign currency with counterfeit notes.

Book your hotels before hand, only after reviewing the location of the hotel. Typically the areas near railway stations are not as nice. I would avoid staying in hotels near railway stations unless totally necessary, say, you need to board a train that leaves before 6 a.m.

Search for “would not like to be there after sun down areas” of the places you would be traveling.

Though the people are in general helpful, I would not recommend taking an empty street where some people “offer to help”. It may simply be a safer location for them to mug you.

Please note this point, especially if you are a woman, DO NOT interact with men unless surrounded by hundreds of people. Being a man, though unfathomable, a certain percentage of men have no regard for consent. Though very few would want to harm you, you are safest in avoiding one.

(Bash me as much as you want the men of India, it is the truth. A certain percentage has no regard for consent, given the number of crimes against women in this country.)

Look out for suspicious behavior of the auto or taxi driver. A lot of rapes happen in autos and taxis in India, even empty buses for that matter. Online cab aggregators are no safer. Avoid people who tell you they would drop you off at your hotel. Just enter a shop or office nearby, telling them you need something there. Explain the situation to the shop owner or the security at the building, they will provide cover till the nuisance disappears.

Watch out for beggars requesting alms. They might just be providing a distraction for their accomplice to pick your pocket.

Again. DO NOT believe all those television programs where one person travels through the country on their own. They are probably accompanied by at least 20 crew members.

However, there are some things where you might be wrong. Be polite to the locals. Though they may not understand English, use “No thanks/Sorry” to avoid peddlers. They are really pushy.

and in this video, I felt bad when you showed that you experienced Racism while interviewing folks in Malana, but AJAY (Kika's friend) must be known that Malana is a unique village and interviewing could lead to repercussions and so it did.
while on the flip side, I felt happy that you enjoyed being in the Himalayas and enjoyed the mesmerizing views of the Himalayas.

Bea Jonite,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGrUyPJ6R1U,Recreating 10 Rachel Green Outfits from FRIENDS | 90s Looks,"This is such a fun concept, great job! I just have one question, because I can’t understand your accent at 3:01. Not that it matters, but I have just been trying to figure out what you said there. It sounds like “Rachel is a total fetus”, but you obviously didn’t say that, lol. Also, it’s so interesting that fashion trends always come back around. It makes you not want to get rid of any trendy clothing in your closet, because once it comes back in fashion, you’d wish you would have kept it. Plaid definitely made a huge comeback, but so did overalls, and even mom jeans. There are some trends from the nineties that I hope will never make a comeback, like those awful acid wash jeans. I didn’t have them then, and hope they stay away, lol. Or that crazy teased hair from the eighties, that can stay away also, in my opinion. I also remember velvet being a big trend back then, and noticed a huge comeback last year, and it still is big this year as well. I didn’t have the teased hair in the eighties, or anything acid washed, but I remember wearing those ski jackets that had three different neon colors in one jacket. I won’t be revisiting that look, nor the tie-dye trend. It’s so interesting to see certain styles come back around years later.",232,0,4.400862068965517
